Dude, just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 The Amateur. It's a ride, lemme tell ya. I mean, have you ever been so into a   that you're screaming at the screen? This was it. The plot twist! Bro, it was wild! I'm sitting there, kinda tired but just glued, ya know? And the main guy, like, I can't even with his decisions. Seriously, the dude had me questioning my life choices. 🤣

I'm legit here thinking, I could never do what this guy does, but at the same time, I'm like, Maybe I should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   to figure out all the stuff I missed? Yeah, right. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 it once has me drained already. The suspense was borderline unhealthy.

> Why do they always have such intense music during the climax? It's like, chill,  , my heart has its limits, thanks. But for real, those twists kept coming like punches, couldn’t catch a break. And the villain? Dude has the charisma of, I dunno, a toaster but with bigger ulterior motives. Made me think back on all those B- s we 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 in college with all the insane plots. Good times. 😆

Anyway, I kept thinking how if I was in those situations, I'd just nope out immediately. But these characters are like, “Let’s go deeper into the mess.” Why?! Like, seriously, you ever just wanna yell at the screen, Just don’t, dude! That was me. Maybe I'll 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again someday, see if I change my mind about it.

console.log(Why am I even doing this);

But hey, let’s catch up soon. We'll have a marathon of wild plots. I’m bringing the snacks, you bring your sanity. 😂
